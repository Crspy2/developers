## Themes

We're always working to create new themes for our merchants. As of today, we have two available themes: `Modern` and `Default`.

You can choose them from your Sellix dashboard, and customize them afterward to make them truly yours.

### SEO

By connecting a custom domain, we will automatically adapt your store to the SEO best practices.

We will index it for search engines, create sitemaps for your products which are automatically generated for every language as well.

You will not have to do anything else, as even metadata for each product page is taken care of.

<Note>After connecting your custom domain, it might take up to a few days for it to be indexed by Google.</Note>

## Email domains

  The same goes for emails, you can customize both the domain where they're sent from, but also the Sender (`Sender`@`domain`).

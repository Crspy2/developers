## Sellix for Platforms

One of the latest features we have released is the Wallet for Platform.

It enables platforms and marketplaces to issue non-custodial wallets to their merchants, then create payments from those wallets and charge merchants any custom fee whilst doing so.

**It essentially is Stripe Connect, but for Cryptocurrencies.**

## Logic flows

### `createMerchant`
- implementation [here](https://github.com/Sellix/platform-wallet-demo/blob/main/server/index.js)
- the platform frontend calls the platform server to create a new user that will be associated with the Sellix `merchant_id`
- the platform server calls Sellix API using the `Sellix API key` (`/wallet/createWalletMerchant`) that returns a `merchant_id` and a `merchant_token` that will be used to authenticate the merchant
- the platform frontend will render Sellix wallet `/setup` page in an iframe with the `merchant_token` as query param
- the merchant will proceed with a regular wallet setup
- when the setup is completed the wallet makes a call directly to Sellix API (instead of using postMessage) to upload the addresses using the `merchant_token`:
  - `/wallet/address` for all the primary addresses
  - `/wallet/reusable_addresses` for NANO and SOLANA reusable addresses
- concordium will not be setup at this point because it requires a different setup flow (see below)

### `getMerchantDashboard` (merchant sees his wallet/dashboard)
- implementation [here](https://github.com/Sellix/platform-wallet-demo/blob/main/server/index.js)
- the merchant calls the platform server to get the wallet url
- the platform server calls Sellix API using the `Sellix API key` (`/wallet/getWalletMerchant`) that returns a `merchant_id` and a `merchant_token` that will be used to authenticate the merchant
- the platform frontend renders the wallet iframe using the wallet url with the merchant token
- the wallet uses the merchant token (instead of receiving postMessage) to make the `/wallet/self` API call to get the merchant addresses created during the setup phase
- the wallet uses the merchant token (instead of receiving postMessage) to make the `/wallet/estimate/<currency>/reusable_addresses` API call to check if there is the need to upload new addresses
- now the wallet is able to perform the following operations in a seameless way like you would do in the Sellix dashboard:

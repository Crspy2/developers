## No-Code implementations

Certain subscription integrations do not require businesses to write a single line of code, let's learn how.

### For communities

If you wish to monetize your Discord or Telegram communities, we have tools for it, and by integrating with our Subscription system you are able to do just that with zero lines of code.

In both cases, by connecting your Discord or Telegram community to our system, you are able to

- Automatically add a customer to your Discord Server/Telegram Group
- Automatically add a role to the customer's Discord user
- Automatically remove the customer from your Discord Server/Telegram Group if they stop paying
- Automatically remove the customer from your Discord Server/Telegram Group if 
the subscription period ends

### For serials

When creating a subscription, you are able to choose a Subtype (`File`, `Serials`, `Service`, `Dynamic`).

<Info>Learn more about Dynamic products [here](/api-reference/dynamic-products)</Info>

By doing so, you can create recurring payments that send to your customer a new kind of product every time that a payment succeeds.

For example, if your product subtype is Serials, we will automatically send your customer a new Serial taken from the configured product.

## Implementation

Integrating subscriptions within your website might require some coding knowledge due to having to listen to webhooks.

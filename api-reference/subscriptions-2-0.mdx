Subscriptions 2.0 offers comprehensive webhook events to keep track of each stage in a subscription's lifecycle. Configure webhooks in your Sellix dashboard to receive notifications for various events.

## Key Events
- **subscription-v2:trial-interval:started**: Triggered when a trial period begins.
- **subscription-v2:started**: Triggered when a subscription begins.
- **subscription-v2:ended**: Triggered at the end of a subscription period.
- **subscription-v2:canceled**: Triggered if a subscription is canceled.
- **subscription-v2:plan:payment-succeeded**: Triggered when a payment is successfully processed.

# Advanced Subscription Features
## Billing Options
Subscriptions 2.0 supports a new and improved billing system with advanced customization options. Each subscription plan can have separate billing settings.
- **Payment Type:** Choose whether customers are charged in `ADVANCE` (at the start of the billing cycle), or `ARREARS` (at the end of the billing cycle; good for usage based subscriptions).
- **Renew Type:** Choose whether the subscription is renewed on the first of every month (`CALENDAR`), or on the anniversary of the subscription start date (`ANNIVERSARY`).
- **Billing Type:** Choose whether customers pay the full amount of the subscription when they first subscribe (`FULL`), or if the subscription is `PROTATED` to dynamically charge the customer based on the remaining time in the billing cycle.
- **Custom Intervals:** Subscriptions 2.0 provides four base intervals: `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, and `YEARLY`, which can be paired with integer values to customize the interval length when creating the subscription product. This implementation has no restrictions on payment method and is handled by Sellix
- **Upgrades/Downgrades:** Subscriptions 2.0 supports **upgrades and downgrades between subscription plans with no overhead**. Everything is handled internally, and webhook events (`subscription-v2:plan:upgrade`) and (`subscription-v2:plan:downgrade`) are automatically emitted so you can handle your server logic accordingly

Customers can change their gateway, payment method, payment plan, and more without creating a new subscription. All changes will automatically take effect, and the price change will automatically take effect as set by the merchant. 

Subscriptions 2.0 support the customer balance, allowing customers to use funds in their customer portal to pay for subscription fees

## Subscription Addons
Specify any additional payment that can be added for a single month or for a longer period of time, giving your customers a way to add optional benefits or perks to your subscriptions.
  - Addons have an optional field called **All Recurring Bill Invoices** similarly to coupons. if it is checked, then the addon will be applied to all invoices created for the subscription, otherwise only for the first invoice.

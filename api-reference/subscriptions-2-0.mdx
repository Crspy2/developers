## Webhook Events for Subscription Lifecycle

Subscriptions 2.0 offers comprehensive webhook events to keep track of each stage in a subscription's lifecycle. Configure webhooks in your Sellix dashboard to receive notifications for various events.

### Journey

<Warning>This journey is a work in progress, it's not final. Expected to be completed soon, check back in a few days.</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trial Started">
    Event `subscription:trial:started`
    
    Optional, sent only if the product has a trial period enabled.

    A trial for one of your product subscriptions has been started. We will not create an invoice for this event.

    If this webhook is sent, it’s preceded by a `subscription:created` event with a unique status

    <Card title="Keep in mind" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" color="#ca8b04">
      Although a subscription has been created, an invoice for it has not been created. `TRIALING` means that the subscription has been created in a trialing state, waiting for `subscription:trial:ended`.
    </Card>

    <Info>Please note that if the product has a trial period, the trial period must be used.</Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trial Ended">
    Event `subscription:trial:ended`

    Optional, sent only if the product has a trial period enabled and it has come to an end.

    A trial for one of your product subscription has ended, we will create an invoice in relation to this event.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Created">
    Event `subscription:created`

    If the product has a trial period, this webhook has already been sent. If not, it is sent right after an invoice `PRODUCT_SUBSCRIPTION` has been successfully paid.

    Once your customer's subscription has been started and the payment has succeeded, you should implement any logic that you might deem necessary to activate the subscription.

    We highly suggest the usage of our custom fields to act as a metadata object in order to recognize which customer purchased your subscription and activate it for them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Updated">
    Event `subscription:updated`
    
    If the customer updates his preferred gateway for the subscription through the Customer Billing Portal, you will receive a webhook event with the updated subscription object.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Cancelled">
    Event `subscription:cancelled`
    
    Should you or the customer decide to cancel the subscription, this webhook event is sent.

    A subscription is canceled if the payment fails, or is not sent within your settings’ grace period (in days). We handle every email for payment failures and renewal updates. You can also update customer notification settings on the [Subscription settings page](https://dashboard.sellix.io/settings/subscriptions) (access it through your Profile > Settings).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Upcoming">
    Event `subscription:upcoming`
    
    The event is sent a few days before a subscription is about to be renewed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Renewed">
    Event `subscription:renewed`
    
    When the payment for a subscription renewal happens, this webhook is sent to let you know that everything went well. You do not need to be listening to this event specifically as you can manage your subscriptions through only the `created` and `cancelled` events.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Subscription Features

Here's a brief list of other cool features, for a full overview see the [full list here](#full-list).

### Billing Options

Subscriptions 2.0 supports a new and improved billing system with advanced customization options. Each subscription plan can have separate billing settings.
- **Payment Type:** Choose whether customers are charged in `ADVANCE` (at the start of the billing cycle), or `ARREARS` (at the end of the billing cycle; good for usage based subscriptions).
- **Renew Type:** Choose whether the subscription is renewed on the first of every month (`CALENDAR`), or on the anniversary of the subscription start date (`ANNIVERSARY`).
- **Billing Type:** Choose whether customers pay the full amount of the subscription when they first subscribe (`FULL`), or if the subscription is `PROTATED` to dynamically charge the customer based on the remaining time in the billing cycle.
- **Custom Intervals:** Subscriptions 2.0 provides four base intervals: `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, and `YEARLY`, which can be paired with integer values to customize the interval length when creating the subscription product. This implementation has no restrictions on payment method and is handled by Sellix
- **Upgrades/Downgrades:** Subscriptions 2.0 supports **upgrades and downgrades between subscription plans with no overhead**. Everything is handled internally, and webhook events (`subscription-v2:plan:upgrade`) and (`subscription-v2:plan:downgrade`) are automatically emitted so you can handle your server logic accordingly

Customers can change their gateway, payment method, payment plan, and more without creating a new subscription. All changes will automatically take effect, and the price change will automatically take effect as set by the merchant. 

Subscriptions 2.0 support the customer balance, allowing customers to use funds in their customer portal to pay for subscription fees

### Subscription Addons

Specify any additional payment that can be added for a single month or for a longer period of time, giving your customers a way to add optional benefits or perks to your subscriptions.

<Info>
  Addons have an optional field called **All Recurring Bill Invoices** similarly to coupons. if it is checked, then the addon will be applied to all invoices created for the subscription, otherwise only for the first invoice.
</Info>

## Customer Billing Portal

Every customer will have access to their customer billing portal, where they can view, cancel, and update any active subscription purchased from you or any other business on our platform.

![customer portal](https://sellix.io/cdn-cgi/image/q=65/https://cdn.sellix.io/static/documentation/images/customer-portal.png)

They will authenticate using their personal email address, used to purchase your product subscription. The customer billing portal can be found at `YOUR_DOMAIN/customer/auth`

## Integrations

Three ways to integrate subscriptions into your website.

<Card title="Sellix Hosted Experience" icon="browser" href="https://dashboard.sellix.io/products">
  You will be using our hosted experience through `YOUR_DOMAIN`, asking customers for their ID/Email/Username through product custom fields to activate the subscription on their account.
</Card>

<Card title="Customized embeds" icon="frame" href="https://dashboard.sellix.io/developer/embed">
  Through product embeds.
  You can embed subscription products on your website, and automatically set hidden custom fields to uniquely identify your customers when the webhook events are sent.
</Card>

<Card title="Developers API" icon="code" href="/api-reference/subscriptions-2-0/post-subscriptions">
  Brandless implementation with our API.
  Use your own logo and website to manage customers and subscriptions.
  Currently, the documentation is hosted on dev-openapi.sellix.io. However, it will soon be available on this page as well, with an improved document.
</Card>

## Cryptocurrencies

From the get-go, we support subscriptions billed automatically through cryptocurrencies.

![customer portal](https://sellix.io/cdn-cgi/image/q=65/https://cdn.sellix.io/static/documentation/images/crypto-subscriptions.png)

This works by approving X recurring payments on the customer's cryptocurrency wallet and automatically sending a transaction for each renewal period.

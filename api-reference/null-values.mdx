title: 'Null Values'
description: 'See how null values are represented in our documentation'

## How they look like
Our documentation is rendered with [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/). 
OpenAPI handles null cases in our examples by replacing instances of `null` values with specific fields that are type dependeng. Below you can see how null values are represented for each individual type:
- String: `"<string>"`,
- Number: `123`
- Integer: `123`
- Object: `{}`
- Array: `["<any>"]`
- Boolean: `true`


## Deprecated fields
When a field is deprecated from our API, it is still sent with all requests with a stringified value of `null` that appears as `"null"`. This is done for backwards compatibility so your software never breaks.

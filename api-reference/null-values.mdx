## Representation of Null Values
Our documentation leverages [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) for rendering. OpenAPI specifically addresses how null values are illustrated in our examples, ensuring that instances of `null` are replaced with placeholders relevant to the data type. Below is a breakdown of how null values are represented for each type:
- **String**: `"<string>"`
- **Number**: `123`
- **Integer**: `123`
- **Object**: `{}`
- **Array**: `["<any>"]`
- **Boolean**: `true`

## Handling Deprecated Fields
In cases where a field is deprecated, our API continues to include the field in all requests as `null`, however, it will be rendered as `"null"`, in a string format, in all of our documentation examples. This approach is maintained for backward compatibility, ensuring that integrations remain functional without disruption.

## Clarification
It's important to clarify that these representations do not reflect the actual return values of our API. Instead, they are utilized solely within our documentation for clarity and example purposes.

## Representation of Null Values
Our documentation leverages [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) for rendering. OpenAPI specifically addresses how null values are illustrated in our examples, ensuring that instances of `null` are replaced with placeholders relevant to the data type. Below is a breakdown of how null values are represented for each type:
- **String**: `"<string>"`
- **Number**: `123`
- **Integer**: `123`
- **Object**: `{}`
- **Array**: `["<any>"]`
- **Boolean**: `true`

## Handling Deprecated Fields
In cases where a field is deprecated, our API continues to include the field in all requests as `null`, however, it will be rendered as `"null"`, in a string format, in all of our documentation examples. This approach is maintained for backward compatibility, ensuring that integrations remain functional without disruption. Deprecated fields will also have the `"DEPRECATED"` prefix in their descriptions.

## Stringified values
In our documentation, you will find instances where integers, booleans and floats are stringified (wrapped in a string). These values should be interpreted as the type of the value inside the string. The examples below should be the only instances in the whole documentation where stringified values should occur. If you see any other values stringified, the API returns them as such.
- `"0"` should be interpreted as a **string**
- `"false"` should be interpreted as a **boolean**

## Clarification
It's important to clarify that these representations do not reflect the actual return values of our API. Instead, they are utilized solely within our documentation for clarity and example purposes.

## Types

Errors will only ever be present with a `400` to `503` response status.

<Warning>`4xx` will be inside the response JSON (`response.data.status`), whilst `5xx` errors are sent as an HTTP status code.</Warning>

All errors will include an `error` attribute detailing the error message.

The Sellix API uses the following error codes:

| Code | Description                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters. |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Unable to authenticate. |
| `403` | Forbidden - The request is not allowed. |
| `404` | Not Found - The specified resource could not be found. |
| `406` | Not Acceptable - You requested a format that isn't json. |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - You have reached the rate limit. |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - We had a problem with our server. Try again later. These are rare. |
| `503` | Service Unavailable - We're temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later. |

# Comparing Subscriptions (legacy) and Subscriptions 2.0

Sellix offers two subscription models — [Subscriptions (legacy)](https://docs.sellix.io/api-reference/subscriptions) and [Subscriptions 2.0](https://docs.sellix.io/api-reference/subscriptions-2-0) — each tailored to different merchant needs. While Subscriptions (legacy) provide fundamental recurring billing features, Subscriptions 2.0 introduces advanced options to support a broader range of business models.
<Info>
While Subscriptions (legacy) products are still available for use, we recommend all new subscriptions be created using Subscriptions 2.0 for continual support and updates.

## General guidance

Sellix provides a webhooks system allowing you to subscribe to events with Webhook Endpoints such as Product/Payment Order status webhooks and Dynamic Product webhooks.

<Warning>Please note only HTTPS webhook URLs are supported.</Warning>

A [webhook simulator](https://dashboard.sellix.io/developer/webhooks/logs) is available allowing you to simulate webhook events to a specified URL.
## Signing/Validating

To verify the authenticity of a webhook request and its payload, each webhook request includes a `X-Sellix-Signature` header with a HMAC signature comprised of the JSON encoded request body and your webhook secret. Your webhook secret can be changed in your [settings page](https://dashboard.sellix.io/settings/shop/general).

<Info>Unlike the API Key, a webhook secret is unique for every shop.</Info>

  <Accordion title="PHP" icon="php">
    ```php
    <?php
      $payload = file_get_contents('php://input');
      $secret = 'WEBHOOK_SECRET'; // replace with your webhook secret, you can find it in your security settings on the sellix dashboard.
      $header_signature = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_SELLIX_SIGNATURE']; // get our signature header
      $signature = hash_hmac('sha512', $payload, $secret);

      if (hash_equals($signature, $header_signature)) {
        // handle valid webhook
      } else {
        // invalid webhook

## Logs

Each webhook request will create a [Webhook Log](https://dashboard.sellix.io/developer/webhooks/all). The object is created by the request that has been sent. Before the request's response has been received, the `response_code` will be 0, indicating it is pending.

<Warning>Logs will only be kept for up to 30 days. After this period they will be deleted</Warning>

## Whitelist Us

Every request will be sent from `99.81.24.41`
